Requirements: Homebrew Channel
              HDD (USB or SD)

Downloads:    Latest version of Nintendont from [here](https://gbatemp.net/threads/nintendont.349258/)
              meta.xml from [here](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/raw/master/nintendont/meta.xml) (right-click>Save As)

1. On the root of your HDD, create a folder called "apps" (no quotes)
2. Inside the apps folder, create another folder called "Nintendont"
3a. Place both files into the Nintendont folder
3b. Rename the "loader.dol" file to "boot.dol"
4. Nintendont is ready to be used as soon as you add some gamecube games
   - Access Nintendont through the Homebrew Channel

3. Drag the gamecube ISO on top of the DiscEx.exe file and a command prompt window should pop up and start to work
4. After DiscEx is done with the ISO, you shuld have a new folder in the same directory as the ISO
   - folder name should be something along the lines of ABCD01
   - contents should include "game.iso" and often another folder named "sys"

Download Configurable USB Loader to play Wii Games on your Wii (WOW how innovative!)

Requirements: Homebrew Channel
              d2x
              HDD (USB or SD)

Downloads:    Cfg USB Loader v70 or later from [here](http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=147638)
              - Original Loader [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/cfg-loader/downloads)
              - Community improvement mods from [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/cfg-loader-mod/downloads)
              - If the latest version is a dol file, also download the most recent zip

1. First, you need to prepare your Hard Drive
   - You can format your drive in one of four different ways
     - WBFS - incompatible with GCN games; supports drives with a sector size of 4k (very rare)
     - FAT32 (recommended) - most compatible; this tool can format your drive for you: found [here](http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/guiformat.exe)
     - NTFS - incompatible with GCN games; useful if you want to use the same drive to play games in Dolphin
     - EXT - incompatible with GCN games; read-only; same benefits at NTFS
2. After preparing your hard drive, unzip the Configurable USB Loader .zip file and copy the contents of Cfg_USB_Loader##/inSDRoot to sd:/ where ## is the version number.
   - You may be asked if you want to merge the directories. Answer yes.
   - After this step, you should have a folder called sd:/usb-loader which contains some files and subdirectories and another folder called sd:/apps/USBLoader that contains boot.dol and some other files.
   - On a Mac, you might need to copy the contents of the directories separately. You want to merge the apps folder in the .zip with the one on your SD card, not replace it.
3. If you downloaded a .dol file as well (the mod version if you downloaded both types), rename the file to boot.dol and replace sd:/apps/USBLoader/boot.dol with the renamed file.
4. Edit meta.xml to use your chosen IOS using the instructions in the next section
5. Start the Homebrew Channel and run Configurable USB Loader.
5. If you get an IOS249 is a stub message, then redo the meta.xml steps, perhaps choosing a different method.
6. You may be asked to select device and partition
   1. Select your device as either SD (if you don't have a drive) or USB if you do
   2. Select your partition from the list that you want to use
   3. Select other options and ensure IOS is set to 247, 248 or 224, depending on what you chose in meta.xml
   4. Confirm the screen to start the loader
   5. Once you are at the GUI, point at the bottom part of the screen to bring up the menu bar and select Settings
   6. Select System in the next dialog
   7. Select Save Settings to save your choice of device and partition.
   8. Push B to return to the GUI and start enjoying Configurable USB Loader

Meta.xml steps (expanded from Step 4 above): Perform only one of the following methods

Method 1
Download a pre-configured meta.xml for IOS248:
   1. Download the pre-configured meta.xml [here](http://gwht.wdfiles.com/local--files/usb-loader/meta.xml) (right-click>Save As)
   2. Replace sd:/apps/USBLoader/meta.xml with the downloaded one.

Method 2
On a Windows machine, you can use the Configurator, included in the Cfg zip package you downloaded:
   1. To start the Configurator, execute the CfgLoaderConfigurator app which will be located in sd:/usb-loader if you followed the above instructions.
      - Alternatively, extract the usb-loader directory in the zip file to your hard drive to get a copy of the Configurator.
   2. Select the Global Options 3 tab.
   3. Select either 248 or 224-mload from the ios drop-down box depending on your preferred choice of IOS (248 is recommended).
   4. Ensure the check box to the left of the ios box is now checked (it should have done so when you selected the ios option).
   5. Select the Meta Arguments tab.
   6. Click the Global Options 3 check box to make it checked
   7. Click the Read meta.xml button and select sd:/apps/USBLoader/meta.xml, then push OK.
   8. Click the Write meta.xml button and push OK to replace the existing file with the one with a new included option.

Method 3
On any machine, open sd:/apps/USBLoader/meta.xml in your favourite text editor and do the following:
   1. Find the line </app> towards the end of the file.
   2. Depending on which ios you want to use as default (248 is recommended) add one of the lines below before </app>:
      - <arguments><arg>ios=248</arg></arguments>
      - <arguments><arg>ios=224-mload</arg></arguments>
   3. Save your changes to meta.xml.
   4. Configurable USB Loader is now ready to be used. Check the information below to see how to use it.

Using the loader
- Your drive MUST be connected in the USB slot closer to the outside edge of the Wii
- The GUI has menu options that will appear if you select a game or point at the top or bottom of the screen.
- Push D-Pad Down to change the display mode of covers. Once you find your favourite one, save settings via Settings…System…Save Settings and it will be default at startup.
- Push the + button to install a game from your Wii's Disc Drive to the USB drive.
- Push the - button to access a menu that lets you delete games from the drive or run discs.
- Use A to play or 1 to enter the options menu of an installed game
- In the GUI, you can change options after pushing A
- You can download covers for all your installed games at once in the options menu.
- Select the download all covers option and push D-pad right.
- Read README-CFG.txt in the zip file to see how to configure Configurable USB Loader to suit your needs or go to the Configurable Options page for simpler instructions.
- As stated in the installation instructions, the /usb-loader folder can be present on either the SD card or the USB drive (as long as the drive is formatted as FAT32 or NTFS). It will work faster on the USB drive, so it is suggested you move the folder to there if it works on your drive.
